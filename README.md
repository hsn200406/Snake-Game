# Welcome to the **SNAKE GAME**!

Famous Snake Game that contains a snake that moves around and captures preys that randomly spawn and keeps growing until reaching the edge or bumping its own tail

## Game rules & Mechanics

    This project contains a script that when running, starts the classic snake game. 
    
    You are in control of the snakes movement limited by moving up, down, right, or left using 
    the arrow keys on your keyboard. 
    
    Each time the snake captures a prey the score increases by one and the snake grows by one 
    square, and so on.
    
    Every time the prey is eaten by the snake, the prey randomly spawns in the 
    window. 
    
    The game gets harder as the snake gets larger and the space is very limited for the 
    snake to move.
    
    If you touch the edges or touch the tail of the snake, the game ends. 
    
### What is the Goal of the Game ?

      Your goal is to maximize your score and show off to your friends your skills!
