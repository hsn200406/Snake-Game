# Welcome to the **SNAKE GAME**!

Famous Snake Game that contains a snake that moves around and captures preys that randomly spawn and keeps growing until reaching the edge or bumping its own tail

## Game Rules & Mechanics

* This project contains a script that, when running, starts the classic snake game.

* You control the snake's movement by using the arrow keys on your keyboard (up, down, left, or right).

 * Each time the snake captures prey:
  - The score increases by one.
  - The snake grows by one square, making movement more challenging.
  - A new prey spawns randomly within the window.

* As the snake grows, the game becomes progressively harder due to the limited space.

* The game ends if the snake:
  - Touches the edge of the screen.
  - Collides with its own tail.
